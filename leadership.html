			<p>Morgan: Do you think Donald is boujee and if so give me an example</p>
			<p>Logan Evans 10th grade: "yes, I do think he is boujee because he likes nice things like our sound system and he once said that him and his friends used to work on the sound systems in their cars to make them sound clearer and we are about to purchase more leadership technology</p>
			
			<p>Morgan: Do you think Donald is boujee?</p>
			<p>Matthew Garcia 10th grade: yes i think Donald is boujee because the little things that he says here and there can be considered really boujee</p>
			<p>Morgan: Do you think Donald is boujee ?</p>
			<p> Geo Espinoza: Yes he's boujee... He is the cheapest boujiest person I know. He will buy top brand things but with a coupon. He loves Amazon, Donald has Amazon Prime. Like you'll ask him for a pencil and he'll order a pack of 30 off of Amazon. Everyone [teachers] has normal desks but his is like a robot.</p>
			<p>Morgan Daniels: Do you think Donald is boujee?</p>
			<p>Cady Tran: Donald is boujee because he dresses like he is. One thing he says often "no salt" and he only buys healthy things. Also he lives in Redondo Beach.</p>
